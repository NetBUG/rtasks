# General
The script is run with `python3 app.py`

## Requirements
Install via `pip3 -r requirements.txt`. 
Virtual environment would be perfectly fine.

Most of comments are written in the code, mostly in `bayesian.py` and in 
`data_loader.py`, as report was not required for that task.

Bayesian models were tested as a baseline to the solution where each independent 
feature might bear important discriminative information. Decision trees were also 
investigated, and gave good prediction accuracy but could not beat 99.9% AUC for
multinomial Bayesian model. It is of no reason to improve current result with 
any kind of boosting. In real world, additional features (like sender information)
and sequential (context-aware) processing would be needed to attain higher accuracy.
